# Menu Example

Vue-tree-table-component may be used not only in tables. Here's an example where it's used to create a menu:

<br />

<MenuExampleComponent />

To achieve this effect we did two things:
1) Passed url in table data
2) Created custom node: to implement custom styles 
2) Created custom leaf: to add action on click
